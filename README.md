[![Plus: Source-Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plus-Source--Available%20%2B%20Key-orange.svg)](LICENSE-PLUS)

> This is the **Core repository** (100 % AGPLv3). The Plus Edition source moved out of this repository with `v1.75.0-beta` and lives at https://github.com/P3Portal-org/p3portal-plus. See [Core vs. Plus](#core-vs-plus) below.

**P3 Portal** is a self-hosted web platform for managing Proxmox VE — a live cluster dashboard, Ansible/Packer automation, networking & firewall management, VM/LXC lifecycle and fine-grained access control. It runs as a single Docker/Podman container; users are managed locally in the portal, and Proxmox API tokens are used by the backend to execute operations on the cluster. An optional **Plus** edition extends it with declarative *Stacks* (infrastructure as code via OpenTofu) and more — see [Core vs. Plus](#core-vs-plus).

### What it does (Core)

- **Cluster dashboard** — live overview of nodes, VMs, LXC containers, CPU/RAM/storage
- **Automation** — parametrised Ansible playbooks with live logs plus in-guest runs via dynamic inventory; Packer template builds from `.pkr.hcl`
- **Networking & firewall** — Linux bridges/VLANs, SDN (zones / VNets / subnets), datacenter / node / VM firewall rules, security groups, IP sets
- **IP address management (IPAM)** — IP pools per network with a best-effort free-IP suggestion at deploy time
- **VM/LXC lifecycle** — detail pages, power & snapshots, clone / migrate / convert-to-template, disk attach/resize, backup-job management, ISO & LXC template management (Image Factory)
- **High availability** — manage Proxmox HA rules/groups and resources on clustered installations
- **Access control** — fine-grained per-VM/LXC RBAC with custom role presets, resource ownership (incl. adopting externally-created VMs), teams and granular admin delegation; permission-aware UI throughout
- **Security & access** — local users, two-factor authentication (TOTP), installable PWA desktop app
- **Job history & API** — every run logged with full output, filterable and searchable; scoped API keys, external jobs API, webhooks
- **Notifications, theming & i18n** — notification hub, built-in themes, DE/EN

> The **Plus** edition adds declarative **Stacks** (VMs / LXC / networks / firewall as code via OpenTofu), an interactive **topology** view, **scheduled jobs & auto-snapshots**, **config snapshots**, resource **pools with quotas**, a **4-eyes approval** workflow, **multi-cluster** dashboards, **Git-sync**, **template replication** across nodes, a stateful **IPAM** (persistent allocations & network grants), alert presets (SMTP / webhook), a theme editor, and **visual editors** for Packer & Ansible. Full breakdown: [Core vs. Plus](#core-vs-plus).

Everything needed to run (Python, Ansible, Packer, the React frontend — plus OpenTofu in the Plus image) is bundled. Nothing needs to be installed on the host.

## Requirements

- Docker ≥ 24 **or** Podman ≥ 4.4 with `podman-compose`
- A reachable Proxmox VE instance (≥ 7.x)
- Proxmox API tokens for the portal service accounts (see [Proxmox Setup](#proxmox-setup))

---

## Deployment

### 1 — Clone and prepare

```bash
git clone https://github.com/P3Portal-org/p3portal.git
cd p3portal

cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
```

### 2 — Configure `.env`

Minimum required values:

```dotenv
SECRET_KEY=<random string, at least 32 characters>
TZ=Europe/Berlin
```

Generate a secure `SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# or
openssl rand -hex 32
```

The admin account is created through the **Setup Wizard** on first start — no credentials needed in `.env`.

See `.env.example` for the full list of options including Proxmox tokens, Packer settings, and the optional audit log.

### 3 — Get the image

The default `docker-compose.yml` and `podman-compose.host-mode.yml` reference `ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest` — pre-built **Core** images (100 % AGPLv3) published on GitHub Container Registry. No local build needed for the default path:

```bash
# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest

# Podman
podman pull ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest
```

Available Core tags:

| Tag | Licence |
|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest` / `:core` | 100 % AGPLv3 |

Versioned tags like `:1.75.0-beta` are also published — use them to pin a specific release.

For the Plus Edition image see the [Core vs. Plus](#core-vs-plus) section below.

### 3a — Build locally (optional)

If you want to build the Core image yourself (e.g. for development or behind an air-gapped network):

```bash
docker build -t p3portal:local .
```

To verify that the build contains no Plus artifacts:

```bash
./tools/verify-core-build.sh p3portal:local
```

### 4 — Start

```bash
# Docker Compose (bridge network — recommended default)
docker compose up -d

# Podman Compose (bridge network — recommended default)
podman-compose up -d

# Podman Compose — host network (required for Packer HTTP-preseed builds)
podman-compose -f podman-compose.host-mode.yml up -d
```

The portal starts on **https://\<host\>:8443**. A self-signed TLS certificate is generated automatically on first start — accept the browser warning or replace the certificate (see below).

#### Automated rootless Podman install (optional)

On a fresh Debian/Ubuntu host you can skip the manual steps above with the
bundled installer. It installs Podman, creates a dedicated non-root user,
writes a self-contained compose stack (Valkey + portal + celery worker) and
enables it as a lingering `systemd --user` service:

```bash
sudo ./p3portal-podman-install.sh
```

It prompts for the app name, image edition (Core/Plus), `SECRET_KEY`, and the
HTTPS + Packer-HTTP ports. Everything is written under
`/home/<app-user>/podman/<app-name>/`.

Or run it straight from the repository. The installer needs root and is
interactive, so use process substitution — a plain `curl … | bash` pipe would
feed the script to bash's stdin and break the prompts:

```bash
sudo bash <(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P3Portal-org/p3portal/main/p3portal-podman-install.sh)
```

Prefer to grab it first? Download, then run (the file is on disk, so you can
inspect it beforehand):

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/P3Portal-org/p3portal/main/p3portal-podman-install.sh
sudo bash p3portal-podman-install.sh
```

Swap `main` for a released tag (e.g. `v1.105.0-beta`) in the URL for a
reproducible install.

### 5 — Setup wizard

Open `https://<host>:8443` in your browser. The built-in wizard guides you through:

1. Licence info (Core is free, no key needed)
2. Database selection (SQLite default / PostgreSQL optional)
3. Admin account
4. Proxmox node connection
5. API tokens
6. Packer token *(optional)*
7. Done — auto-login

---

## Volumes & persistent data

All state lives in `./data/`, which is mounted into every container:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data/portal.db` | SQLite database — jobs, config, users |
| `data/*.log` | Job output and Proxmox audit logs |
| `data/valkey.pwd` | Auto-generated Valkey password (created on first start) |

Mount your own playbooks and Packer definitions via the existing volume declarations in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./ansible:/app/ansible      # Ansible playbooks + meta.yaml
  - ./packer:/app/packer        # Packer .pkr.hcl + meta.yaml
  - ./data:/app/data            # logs & database (persistent)
```

Both `ansible/` and `packer/` are mounted read-write so the portal's upload features (playbook bundles, Packer templates) can drop files there at runtime.

### Starter pack

Ready-to-use example playbooks and Packer templates live in [`examples/starter-pack/`](examples/starter-pack/) and are included in the image. Copy them into your mounted `ansible/` and `packer/` directories to get going quickly — they show all `meta.yaml` patterns documented in [`docs/meta-yaml-reference.md`](docs/meta-yaml-reference.md).

---

## TLS / HTTPS

### Default — self-signed certificate

The container generates `ssl/portal.crt` + `ssl/portal.key` on first start and serves directly on port `8443` via TLS. To use your own certificate, place `portal.crt` and `portal.key` in `./ssl/` before starting.

### Optional — Caddy reverse proxy

Generate a self-signed cert for your server IP and let Caddy terminate TLS:

```bash
SERVER_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
mkdir -p ssl
openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout ssl/portal.key -out ssl/portal.crt \
    -days 3650 -subj "/CN=p3portal.local" \
    -addext "subjectAltName=IP:${SERVER_IP}"
```

A `Caddyfile` is included in the repository for reference.

---

## Network modes

The default setup uses a bridge network (`portal-net`), which is right for most LAN/VPN environments.

If you need host networking — for example when Packer's HTTP-preseed server (port `8103`) must be reachable directly by Proxmox VMs during a template build — two options are available:

**Docker Compose** — copy and activate the override example:

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
# adjust if needed, then:
docker compose up -d
```

**Podman Compose** — use the dedicated host-mode file:

```bash
podman-compose -f podman-compose.host-mode.yml up -d
```

> After switching to host mode, set the **Packer HTTP IP** in System Settings to the IP address of the host machine.

> P3 Portal is designed for **LAN / VPN** environments. Exposing it to the public internet is outside the supported scope.

---

## Updating

Default (pulling pre-built images from GHCR):

```bash
# Docker
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

# Podman
podman-compose pull && podman-compose up -d
```

If you build locally instead:

```bash
git pull
docker build -t p3portal:local .
docker compose up -d   # adjust image: in docker-compose.yml to p3portal:local
```

Database schema migrations run automatically on startup.

### PostgreSQL (optional)

SQLite is the default and works well for single-server deployments. For multi-user team setups or when you need concurrent write access, PostgreSQL 14+ is supported as a production database.

Quick setup — add to `.env` and start with the overlay:

```bash
# .env
DB_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://p3portal:changeme@postgres:5432/p3portal
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme

# start
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
```

The overlay adds a `postgres:17-alpine` service and a `postgres-backup` sidecar that runs nightly `pg_dump` into `./data/db-backup/` (keeps the last 7 dumps by default).

See [docs/postgres-deployment.md](docs/postgres-deployment.md) for full details including backup, restore, and pool tuning.

---

## Proxmox Setup

The portal needs up to four API tokens with different privilege levels. The first three are mandatory; the `packer` token is only required if you want to use the Image Factory / Packer builds.

| Token | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `portal-viewer@pve!portal-viewer` | `PVEAuditor` | Read cluster state |
| `portal-operator@pve!portal-operator` | `PVEVMAdmin` | Ansible playbook execution |
| `portal-admin@pve!portal-admin` | `Administrator` | Full management actions |
| `portal-packer@pve!portal-packer` *(optional)* | custom role | Packer template builds + ISO download |

The `portal-packer` role needs `VM.Allocate`, `VM.Clone`, `Datastore.AllocateTemplate`, `VM.Config.Disk`, and on PVE ≥ 8 also `Sys.AccessNetwork` (required by Proxmox's `download-url` endpoint).

Step-by-step `pveum` instructions are in [`docs/proxmox-setup.md`](docs/proxmox-setup.md). Per-endpoint token usage is documented in [`docs/token-usage.md`](docs/token-usage.md).
