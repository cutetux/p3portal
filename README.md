# P3 Portal

[![Core: AGPLv3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Core-AGPLv3-blue.svg)](LICENSE)
[![Plus: Source-Available](https://img.shields.io/badge/Plus-Source--Available%20%2B%20Key-orange.svg)](LICENSE-PLUS)

> This is the **Core repository** (100 % AGPLv3). The Plus Edition source moved out of this repository with `v1.75.0-beta` and lives at https://github.com/P3Portal-org/p3portal-plus. See [Core vs. Plus](#core-vs-plus) below.

**P3 Portal** is a self-contained Docker/Podman container that provides a web GUI for managing Proxmox clusters. Users are managed locally in the portal; Proxmox API tokens are used by the backend to execute operations on the cluster.

### What it does

- **Cluster Dashboard** — live overview of nodes, VMs, LXC containers, CPU/RAM/storage
- **Ansible Playbook Runner** — parametrised playbook execution with live log streaming
- **Packer Template Builder** — build Proxmox VM templates from `.pkr.hcl` definitions
- **Job History** — all runs logged with full output, filterable and searchable
- **Permission-aware UI** — users see only what their Proxmox role permits

Everything needed to run (Python, Ansible, Packer, the React frontend) is bundled in the image. Nothing needs to be installed on the host.

## Requirements

- Docker ≥ 24 **or** Podman ≥ 4.4 with `podman-compose`
- A reachable Proxmox VE instance (≥ 7.x)
- Proxmox API tokens for the portal service accounts (see [Proxmox Setup](#proxmox-setup))

---

## Deployment

### 1 — Clone and prepare

```bash
git clone https://github.com/P3Portal-org/p3portal.git
cd p3portal

cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
```

### 2 — Configure `.env`

Minimum required values:

```dotenv
SECRET_KEY=<random string, at least 32 characters>
TZ=Europe/Berlin
```

Generate a secure `SECRET_KEY`:

```bash
python3 -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
# or
openssl rand -hex 32
```

The admin account is created through the **Setup Wizard** on first start — no credentials needed in `.env`.

See `.env.example` for the full list of options including Proxmox tokens, Packer settings, and the optional audit log.

### 3 — Get the image

The default `docker-compose.yml` and `podman-compose.host-mode.yml` reference `ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest` — pre-built **Core** images (100 % AGPLv3) published on GitHub Container Registry. No local build needed for the default path:

```bash
# Docker
docker pull ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest

# Podman
podman pull ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest
```

Available Core tags:

| Tag | Licence |
|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest` / `:core` | 100 % AGPLv3 |

Versioned tags like `:1.75.0-beta` are also published — use them to pin a specific release.

For the Plus Edition image see the [Core vs. Plus](#core-vs-plus) section below.

### 3a — Build locally (optional)

If you want to build the Core image yourself (e.g. for development or behind an air-gapped network):

```bash
docker build -t p3portal:local .
```

To verify that the build contains no Plus artifacts:

```bash
./tools/verify-core-build.sh p3portal:local
```

### 4 — Start

```bash
# Docker Compose (bridge network — recommended default)
docker compose up -d

# Podman Compose (bridge network — recommended default)
podman-compose up -d

# Podman Compose — host network (required for Packer HTTP-preseed builds)
podman-compose -f podman-compose.host-mode.yml up -d
```

The portal starts on **https://\<host\>:8443**. A self-signed TLS certificate is generated automatically on first start — accept the browser warning or replace the certificate (see below).

### 5 — Setup wizard

Open `https://<host>:8443` in your browser. The built-in wizard guides you through:

1. Licence info (Core is free, no key needed)
2. Database selection (SQLite default / PostgreSQL optional)
3. Admin account
4. Proxmox node connection
5. API tokens
6. Packer token *(optional)*
7. Done — auto-login

---

## Volumes & persistent data

All state lives in `./data/`, which is mounted into every container:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `data/portal.db` | SQLite database — jobs, config, users |
| `data/*.log` | Job output and Proxmox audit logs |
| `data/valkey.pwd` | Auto-generated Valkey password (created on first start) |

Mount your own playbooks and Packer definitions via the existing volume declarations in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./ansible:/app/ansible      # Ansible playbooks + meta.yaml
  - ./packer:/app/packer        # Packer .pkr.hcl + meta.yaml
  - ./data:/app/data            # logs & database (persistent)
```

Both `ansible/` and `packer/` are mounted read-write so the portal's upload features (playbook bundles, Packer templates) can drop files there at runtime.

### Starter pack

Ready-to-use example playbooks and Packer templates live in [`examples/starter-pack/`](examples/starter-pack/) and are included in the image. Copy them into your mounted `ansible/` and `packer/` directories to get going quickly — they show all `meta.yaml` patterns documented in [`docs/meta-yaml-reference.md`](docs/meta-yaml-reference.md).

---

## TLS / HTTPS

### Default — self-signed certificate

The container generates `ssl/portal.crt` + `ssl/portal.key` on first start and serves directly on port `8443` via TLS. To use your own certificate, place `portal.crt` and `portal.key` in `./ssl/` before starting.

### Optional — Caddy reverse proxy

Generate a self-signed cert for your server IP and let Caddy terminate TLS:

```bash
SERVER_IP=$(hostname -I | awk '{print $1}')
mkdir -p ssl
openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 \
    -keyout ssl/portal.key -out ssl/portal.crt \
    -days 3650 -subj "/CN=p3portal.local" \
    -addext "subjectAltName=IP:${SERVER_IP}"
```

A `Caddyfile` is included in the repository for reference.

---

## Network modes

The default setup uses a bridge network (`portal-net`), which is right for most LAN/VPN environments.

If you need host networking — for example when Packer's HTTP-preseed server (port `8103`) must be reachable directly by Proxmox VMs during a template build — two options are available:

**Docker Compose** — copy and activate the override example:

```bash
cp docker-compose.override.yml.example docker-compose.override.yml
# adjust if needed, then:
docker compose up -d
```

**Podman Compose** — use the dedicated host-mode file:

```bash
podman-compose -f podman-compose.host-mode.yml up -d
```

> After switching to host mode, set the **Packer HTTP IP** in System Settings to the IP address of the host machine.

> P3 Portal is designed for **LAN / VPN** environments. Exposing it to the public internet is outside the supported scope.

---

## Updating

Default (pulling pre-built images from GHCR):

```bash
# Docker
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d

# Podman
podman-compose pull && podman-compose up -d
```

If you build locally instead:

```bash
git pull
docker build -t p3portal:local .
docker compose up -d   # adjust image: in docker-compose.yml to p3portal:local
```

Database schema migrations run automatically on startup.

---

## Proxmox Setup

The portal needs up to four API tokens with different privilege levels. The first three are mandatory; the `packer` token is only required if you want to use the Image Factory / Packer builds.

| Token | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `portal-viewer@pve!portal-viewer` | `PVEAuditor` | Read cluster state |
| `portal-operator@pve!portal-operator` | `PVEVMAdmin` | Ansible playbook execution |
| `portal-admin@pve!portal-admin` | `Administrator` | Full management actions |
| `portal-packer@pve!portal-packer` *(optional)* | custom role | Packer template builds + ISO download |

The `portal-packer` role needs `VM.Allocate`, `VM.Clone`, `Datastore.AllocateTemplate`, `VM.Config.Disk`, and on PVE ≥ 8 also `Sys.AccessNetwork` (required by Proxmox's `download-url` endpoint).

Step-by-step `pveum` instructions are in [`docs/proxmox-setup.md`](docs/proxmox-setup.md). Per-endpoint token usage is documented in [`docs/token-usage.md`](docs/token-usage.md).

## Core vs. Plus

Two independent image streams. Choose at pull time.

| Image | Built from | Licence |
|---|---|---|
| `ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal:latest` (= `:core`) | this repository (AGPLv3) | 100 % AGPLv3 |
| `ghcr.io/p3portal-org/p3portal-plus:latest` | https://github.com/P3Portal-org/p3portal-plus (Source-Available) | AGPLv3 (Core) + [LICENSE-PLUS](LICENSE-PLUS) (Plus modules) |

The Plus image embeds the same Core code plus the proprietary `backend/plus/` / `frontend/src/plus/` modules. Without a `plus.lic` runtime key the Plus features stay locked and the image behaves like Core. With a valid key the features below unlock.

|---|---|---|---|
| Proxmox cluster dashboard | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Ansible playbook runner | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Packer template builder | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
